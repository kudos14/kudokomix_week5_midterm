                ... but i kall myself KUDOS online, because it sounds like my last name. either works <br><br> i am a digital artist and graphic designer with too much free time on my hands, and a computer. thus, KUDOKOMIX is born; as an aspiring artist, i have always wanted to create some sort of webcomic... i just haven't thought about what it's gonna be about, yet. i think the logical first step in the process is to have somewhere to STORE said comic, so i decided to spend my time in my college web design class making a website for it! this branding isn't permanent- or maybe it is, we'll see- it might change once i figure out what i'm gonna do with this <br><br> for now, this site will be host to a few one-off silly comics i make during my free time, as well as some placeholders just for the sake of proof of concept. make yourself comfortable :P <br>
